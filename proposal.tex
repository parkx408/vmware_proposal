%% {\em The main body of the proposal should be a clear statement of
%% the work to be undertaken and should include: objectives for the
%% period of the proposed work and expected significance, relation to
%% longer-term goals of the PI's project, and relation to the present
%% state of knowledge in the field, to work in progress by the PI
%% under other support and to work in progress elsewhere.  The
%% statement should outline the general plan of work, including 
%% the broad design of activities to be undertaken, an adequate
%% description of experimental methods and procedures, and if
%% appropriate, plans for preservation, documentation, and sharing of
%% data, samples, physical collections and other related research
%% products.  Any substantial collaboration with individuals not
%% included in the budget should be described with a letter from 
%% each \ldots.}
